## Overview

Spring Cloud Sleuth Zipkin Microservice Log Tracing Server is a distributed tracing system built with Spring Boot and Zipkin. It facilitates the gathering of timing data necessary for troubleshooting latency issues in service architectures. The system includes both the collection and lookup of this data, providing insights into the flow of requests through your microservices.

## Features

- **Distributed Tracing:** Monitor and trace requests as they travel through different microservices.
- **Performance Analysis:** Identify bottlenecks and latency problems in your microservices architecture.
- **Dependency Visualization:** Understand the interactions and dependencies between various microservices.
